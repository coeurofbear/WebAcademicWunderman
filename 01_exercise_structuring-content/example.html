Introduction into html
In the beginning of the workshop we learned that HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML files are normal text files with the file extension .html or .html. It is one of the three core languages of web development.
Current state of HTML
HTML4
Was the beginning of standards in the specification of HTML and started to push browsers to follow these specifications.
XHTML 1.0
W3C tried to push HTML into XML standards and creating more strict specifications. The work on the specifications stopped in 2009.
HTML5
The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group started working parallel to the W3C on their own standard. Eventually W3C adapted and started following the same route.
Content of a HTML document
Doctype
Has to be at the beginning of every document and tells the user agent which HTML standard is used.
Head
